## Tag Cloud
A __tag cloud__ is a novel visual representation of text data, usually used to represent keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. A tag cloud is a visual representation of text data. Tags are typically single words, and font size or color is used to indicate the value of each tag. To evaluate its relative importance, this format is useful for quickly perceiving the most popular words. The larger word means higher weight.

## Description
* In this project, we take text file as an input, and the output is an interactive cloud, and the words are displayed depending on the frequency of the occurrence of them. The bigger the size of the word, the larger is the frequency of occurrence. On hovering on the word, it will display the frequency.
* We used Python, CSS, JavaScript and, HTML. 

## Usage
* __Step 1:__ Open the folder "stand-alone-word-cloud" present in the repository.
* __Step 2:__ Open the folder "dist".
* __Step 3:__ Run the word_cloud.exe.
* The word cloud will be generated in a HTML file which will open in a browser.
* The shuffle button can be used to shuffle all the words. 
* The color button can be used to randomly.
* The pop button can be used to randomly pop a word from the tag cloud.
* The text, which is being used to generate the word cloud can be altered in the "text.txt" file present in "dist" folder.
